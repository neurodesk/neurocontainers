QSMbly is a browser-based Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) tool built with Rust and WebAssembly. It provides an interactive pipeline for processing MRI phase data, including phase unwrapping, background field removal, and dipole inversion.

## Usage

Launch the webapp in Neurodesk JupyterLab to access the QSMbly interface. Load NIfTI files and configure the QSM processing pipeline directly in the browser.
