  It is said that `imitation is the sincerest form of flattery`. This project emulates the popular [fslmaths](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fslcourse/lectures/practicals/intro3/index.html) tool. fslmaths is advertised as a `general image calculator` and is not only one of the foundational tools for FSL's brain imaging pipelines (such as [FEAT](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FEAT)), but has also been widely adopted by many tools. This popularity suggests that it fulfills an important niche. While scientists are often encouraged to discover novel solutions, it sometimes seems that replication is undervalued. Here are some specific reasons for creating this tool:
