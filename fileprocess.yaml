# File Processing Tool Configuration

# Multiple ways to specify files - you can use any combination:

# Option 1: Multiple glob patterns
glob_patterns:
  - "recipes/*/build.yaml"
  - "macros/*/neurodocker.yaml"

# Option 2: Explicit file list
files:
  - builder/README.md
  - builder/build.py

# Template for the system prompt (supports Go text/template syntax)
# Available variables: .FileCount, .Files, .FilesJSON
system_prompt: |
  You are an AI assistant that analyzes files and provides insights based on the user's prompt. 
  The files are provided in JSON format with their paths, content, and detected file types for easier processing.

  You are analyzing {{.FileCount}} files total.

# Template for the user prompt (supports Go text/template syntax)
# Available variables: .FileCount, .Files, .FilesJSON

  Here are the files I need you to analyze:

  {{.FilesJSON}}

  The overall goals we have as a project is to make the packaging more accessible to regular scientists
  not just expert devops, and to make the containers more reproducible and reliable. For this reason you
  should focus on suggestions that improve usability and focus on making recipes easier to write.

  I know you'll see many issues with the overall project but your job is to figure out useful abstractions
  within the context of the existing system. Understand that YAML files are written with a graphical interface
  and not by hand.
